A small Python package for the processing of data from *gotito*, the GOTO CMOS pathfinder telescope.

## Requirements
- Astrometry.net (http://astrometry.net/) installed locally with appropriate indexes and
    `solve-field` in the PATH.
- Python 3.6 or later.
- Patience, as the priority of this package is to be functional and not necessarily efficient.
